## ðŸ§  Core Features

- **Image Classification** of mango leaves into 8 categories:
  - Anthracnose
  - Bacterial Canker
  - Cutting Weevil
  - Die Back
  - Gall Midge
  - Healthy
  - Powdery Mildew
  - Sooty Mould
- **Remedy Suggestions** based on disease prediction
- Real-time image upload via **Streamlit UI**
- Uses a **pre-trained CNN model** saved in `.keras` format
- Simple **drag-and-drop UX** with animated result handling

---

## ðŸ§± Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow** / Keras (image classification, CNN model training)
- **Streamlit** (interactive frontend)
- **PIL** / **NumPy** (image preprocessing)
- **Python 3.8** (compatible with legacy and current TensorFlow APIs)
