## ðŸ§  Core Features

- **Image Classification** of mango leaves into 8 categories:
  - Anthracnose
  - Bacterial Canker
  - Cutting Weevil
  - Die Back
  - Gall Midge
  - Healthy
  - Powdery Mildew
  - Sooty Mould
- **Remedy Suggestions** based on disease prediction
- Real-time image upload via **Streamlit UI**
- Uses a **pre-trained CNN model** saved in `.keras` format
- Simple **drag-and-drop UX** with animated result handling

---

## ðŸ§± Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow** / Keras (image classification, CNN model training)
- **Streamlit** (interactive frontend)
- **PIL** / **NumPy** (image preprocessing)
- **Python 3.8** (compatible with legacy and current TensorFlow APIs)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mango-leaf-detection.git
cd mango-leaf-detection

# (Recommended) Create and activate virtual environment
conda create -n mango_tf python=3.8
conda activate mango_tf

pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
The app will launch at http://localhost:8501

ðŸ§¾ Dataset & Model Files
ðŸ”— Google Drive Folder â€” Dataset & Trained Models

Contains:

ðŸ“‚ mango-leaf-disease-dataset/ â€“ Training & validation images

ðŸ“¦ mango_model_fixed.keras â€“ Final model compatible with new TensorFlow APIs

ðŸ“¦ *.h5 â€“ Legacy versions for backward compatibility

ðŸ’¡ Credits
Developed as part of a university project for MIS 776: Image Classification, Fall 2024.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
The model currently uses a fixed softmax classifier; improvements could include confidence thresholds and ensemble voting.

Ensure consistent TensorFlow/Keras versions to avoid deserialization issues (InputLayer incompatibilities).
